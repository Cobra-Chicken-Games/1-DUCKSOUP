-- This is the file where you are describing the database schema of your game
-- Basically, you just have to export from PhpMyAdmin your table structure and copy/paste
-- this export here.
-- Note that the database itself and the standard tables ("global", "stats", "gamelog" and "player") are
-- already created and must not be created here

-- Note: The database schema is created from this file when the game starts. If you modify this file,
--       you have to restart a game to see your changes in database.

-- Example 1: create a standard "card" table to be used with the "Deck" tools (see example game "hearts"):

-- CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `card` (
--   `card_id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
--   `card_type` varchar(16) NOT NULL,
--   `card_type_arg` int(11) NOT NULL,
--   `card_location` varchar(16) NOT NULL,
--   `card_location_arg` int(11) NOT NULL,
--   PRIMARY KEY (`card_id`)
-- ) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 AUTO_INCREMENT=1 ;


-- Example 2: add a custom field to the standard "player" table
-- ALTER TABLE `player` ADD `player_my_custom_field` INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT '0';

-- Create a database named ducksoupdb
-- CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS ducksoupdb;
-- USE ducksoupdb;


-- Alter the 'player' table to add new columns
ALTER TABLE `player` 
    ADD `is_on_vacation` BOOL DEFAULT FALSE;
